_DESCRIPTION = """\
The Green Earth API powers Bluesky content recommendation for the
[Green Earth](https://greenearth.social) feed generator.  External
Atmosphere Protocol developers can use it as a building block for their
own content-discovery pipelines.

## Pipeline overview

The core recommendation pipeline has three stages that can be used
independently or chained together:

1. **Candidates** – retrieve posts from one or more named generators
   (popularity, similarity, followed users, random …).
2. **Rank** – score the candidate list with a trained engagement-prediction
   model and return posts in descending score order.
3. **Diversify** – rerank the ordered list with Maximal Marginal Relevance
   (MMR) to reduce topical redundancy while preserving relevance.

A typical integration calls `/candidates/generate`, pipes the result into
`/rank/predict`, then optionally calls `/diversify` before presenting posts
to a user.

## Content search

The **Skylight** endpoints (`/skylight/search` and `/skylight/similar`)
provide standalone full-text and vector-similarity search over the post
index.  They are independent of the candidate/rank/diversify pipeline and
can be used on their own.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require an `X-API-Key` header.  Use the **Authorize**
button above to set your key.

The AT Protocol XRPC endpoints (`/xrpc/…`) use JWT authentication issued
by the Bluesky AppView and do not require an API key.
